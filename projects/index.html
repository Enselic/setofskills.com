<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Below are some noteworthy projects of mine.

<h3>GIMP contributions</h3>
<p>
	For roughly 5 years, I spent my spare time contributing code
	to the GNU Image Manipulation Program. I did a lot of things; too numerous to be enumerated here, but the most significant
	contributions I made during this time are as follows. All of
	them was in collaboration with interaction
	architect <a href="http://www.mmiworks.net/eng/publications/blog.html">Peter
	Sikking</a>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.4:</i> Completely rewrote a large portion of the
		code that lets the user manage the rectangle of the
		<i>Rectangle/Ellipse Select and Crop tools</i>, and further
		improved it in GIMP 2.6.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.6:</i> Wrote the code that greatly enhanced
		the <i>Free Select Tool</i> to for example make it possible
		to make polygonal selections.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.8:</i> Implemented Peter's Save+export
		specification so that several severe usability problems
		related to saving was fixed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.8:</i> Implemented the basics of Peter's
		Single-window mode and improved the classic multi-window
		mode, for example allowing multi-colum dock windows.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Taste (Currently offline)</h3>

<p>
	Maintainers of anticipated projects often have to answer the
	question "when are you done?". It is relatively easy to answer
	this question, just enumerate things left to do and their
	relative sizes, and plot the work left over time. Through
	extrapolation it is usually possible to get a good felling for
	the progress of a project and when it will complete.
</p>

<p>
	This all becomes a lot easier with a good tool. I wanted to
	have such a tool for GIMP 2.8, but I found none that met my
	needs: public project pages, open source platform, not a
	terrible user interface. So I wrote <i><strike>tasktaste.com</strike></i>. <br/><strong>Update:</strong> Note that I have
	taken the site offline for now. The domain has been taken over by some SEO company. I might put it back online later, but
	if I do it will be at the URL <i>https://setofskills.com/task-taste</i>.

	On tasktaste.com, anyone can create an account and start
	tracking the progress of their projects for the world to see.
