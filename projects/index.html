<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>bat contributions</h3>
<p>
	Since 2021 I am co-maintaining and improving the excellent tool <a
	href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> which essentially is cat but
	with syntax highlighting (and more). It is written in Rust and uses the
	great <a href="https://github.com/trishume/syntect">syntect</a> library that
	supports Sublime Text <a
	href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html">syntax definitions</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The default install comes with support for 160+ languages.

<h3>GIMP contributions</h3>
<p>
	For roughly 5 years, I spent my spare time contributing code
	to the GNU Image Manipulation Program. I did a lot of things; too numerous to be enumerated here, but the most significant
	contributions I made during this time are as follows. All of
	them was in collaboration with interaction
	architect <a href="http://www.mmiworks.net/eng/publications/blog.html">Peter
	Sikking</a>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.4:</i> Completely rewrote a large portion of the
		code that lets the user manage the rectangle of the
		<i>Rectangle/Ellipse Select and Crop tools</i>, and further
		improved it in GIMP 2.6.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.6:</i> Wrote the code that greatly enhanced
		the <i>Free Select Tool</i> to for example make it possible
		to make polygonal selections.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.8:</i> Implemented Peter's Save+export
		specification so that several severe usability problems
		related to saving was fixed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>GIMP 2.8:</i> Implemented the basics of Peter's
		Single-window mode and improved the classic multi-window
		mode, for example allowing multi-colum dock windows.
	</li>
</ul>
