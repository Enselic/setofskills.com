<p>Welcome to my new site; both the new domain name <a href="https://setofskills.com">setofskills.com</a> and the new layout. So why change domain? Partly for a fresh start. This is now a general programmer's blog that will try to include some interaction design perspectives, not a GIMP developer blog. Partly to remove the accidental Google Chrome association <a href="http://www.chromecode.com">chromecode.com</a> got (which I registered 5 years before Google Chrome was released by the way). Since my old site probably is perceived as a bit dead since the last blog post was more than 4 years ago, I thought now would be a good time to change domain. All old blog posts have been ported to the new site though.<p>

<p>So why change layout? Partly to freshen it up, partly to learn new things. You see, my old site had the blog hosted by Blogger, and the rest on a cheap Danish web host. The new site is hosted in the Amazon cloud and is built on fresh(er) front-end technology such as SCSS, CSS3 animations, screen size responsiveness, Bootstrap, Jekyll and RequireJS. There's also HTTPS for good measure. The color scheme is inspired by my new main editor Sublime Text. So long Emacs, and thanks (not) for all the <strike>fish</strike> Lisp.</p>

<p>As for time over for coding, it is still low. I now have two kids to raise. Occasionally I get some code written though, so keep your eyes open for announcements in 1-10 years.
