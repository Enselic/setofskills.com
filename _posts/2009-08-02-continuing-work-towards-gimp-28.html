<p>I have promised myself to write at least one post per month in this blog. In this post, I will give a general update. In essence, we are simply working our way through the important items on the <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=GIMP&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;target_milestone=2.8">2.8 milestone list</a>. Once those are taken care of, and once the successful GSoC 2009 projects have been merged, GIMP 2.8 will be released.</p>

<p>With the release of GIMP 2.8 we have some really interesting times ahead because it has been agreed that the version after that will not be released until we have completely ported GIMP to GEGL and introduced long sought for features such as a single-window mode (which I will personally ensure happens), layer groups (currently hacked on by mitch), and constructs similar to adjustment layers found in PS.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we will also manage to release the first development version of GIMP 2.8 as soon as possible, GIMP 2.7.0. We're just waiting for a GIMP 2.6.7 release first that the currently very busy Sven is trying to get out.</p>
