<p>A lot of things has happened since <a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gimp/commit/?id=8354a781775e98c4cb96c75925918de4b6119436">my first patch</a> for GIMP was commited almost three years ago. GIMP has undergone two stable releases, used three version control systems, improved a whole lot, and my involvement in the project has increased significantly.  There is however a lot of work that still needs to be done, the two most important being improving the user interface and finish the integration of GEGL.</p>

<p>In this blog I intend to describe my continued involvement in creating the best free, open source image editor in existence together with people like <a href="http://svenfoo.geekheim.de/">Sven Neumann</a>, <a href="http://gimpfoo.de/">Michael Natterer</a>, <a href="http://pippin.gimp.org/">Øyvind Kolås</a> and <a href="http://www.mmiworks.net/eng/publications/blog.html">Peter Sikking</a>.</p>
