<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is the personal website of Martin "Enselic" Nordholts.
It contains my blog and other stuff.
Nowadays I mostly raise my wonderful kids during my spare time, but occasionally I get some coding done. I enjoy creating
and contributing to open source software, often with a focus on interaction design and usability, although I am comfortable hacking on C or Java library code too. 
</p>


<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>I will happily answer questions and listen to
feedback. Please send mails
to <i>my_nickname_described_above</i> at gmail dot com. I
check my mail regularily.
